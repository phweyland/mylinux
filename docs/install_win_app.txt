How to install in Ubuntu 17.04. use17 steps written by John Wolter in winehq

.Net 4.5.2 downloaded from Microsoft site here
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642
Needed dlls downloaded from here. You will need both, the 32-bit and the 64-bit version

Extract .msi package from install .exe file. Not sure this is mandatory but doesn't hurt.
Unlike the video, using the system wine (instead wine 2.1 stage) does work.
Remain to solve:
- webhelper fails. Not a big deal.

Procedure with wine-stable 5.0.1

$ export WINEARCH=win64
$ winetricks vcrun2013 vcrun2015 corefonts
$ winetricks win7
- Download .NET Framework 4.5.2 (offline version) and install it with the command:
$ wine start /unix NDP452-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe
- Then run the actual SketchUp installer:
$ wine SketchUp2017-x64.msi
- Follow the installation steps
- Run SketchUp (you can run it just fine from the .desktop created by WINE itself)

The plugin fix_sketchup_wine.rb helps to get right behavior on object selection
Extension manager works but all popups miss the close button.
Some extensions work

For google sketchup 8
install 'nvidia-driver-libs-i386:i386' and 'nvidia-vulkan-icd:i386' packages
new prefix
$ export WINEARCH=win64
$ winetricks corefonts vcrun6 vcrun2005
$ wine start "GoogleSketchup install.exe"
Run Google SketchUp
In regedit make sure HCU\Software\Google\SketcUp8\GLConfig\Display\HW_OK=1
The plugin fix_sketchup_wine.rb is as useful as for SketchUp 2017
