Procedure with wine-stable 5.0.1

$ export WINEARCH=win64
$ winetricks vcrun2013 vcrun2015 corefonts
$ winetricks win7
- Download .NET Framework 4.5.2 (offline version) and install it with the command:
$ wine start /unix NDP452-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe
- Then run the actual SketchUp installer:
$ wine SketchUp2017-x64.msi
- Follow the installation steps
- Run SketchUp (you can run it just fine from the .desktop created by WINE itself)
