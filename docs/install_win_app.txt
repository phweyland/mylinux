How to install in Ubuntu 17.04. use17 steps writen by John Wolter in winehq

.Net 4.5.2 downloaded from Microsoft site here
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642

Needed dlls downloaded from here. You will need both, the 32-bit and the 64-bit version

Extract .msi package from install .exe file. Not sure this is mandatory but doesn't hurt.
Unlike the video, using the system wine (instead wine 2.1 stage) does work.

Remain to solve:
- webhelper fails. Not a big deal.
