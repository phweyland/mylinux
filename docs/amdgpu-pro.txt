14/11/2020 kernel 5.9. onlyf this way works:
AMD/ATI Drivers (amdgpu, radeon, r128, mach64)

Tried several ways to install the amd drivers without success:
AMDGPUDriverOnStretchAndBuster2

Install amdgpu-pro packages on Debian (openCL, mesa, VCE) only.

There is also a way to set up a temporary source on amdgpu-pro and to install from there
only what's needed
