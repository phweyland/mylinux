This really depends on how you are going to restore your system. If you will rebuild then you only need the configuration/data files for your services (eg: /etc, /opt, /var, /home)
If you are after a full system restore, then it you could omit /proc, /boot & /dev. Then you can install the minimum OS from your boot media and then restore your system via your backup.
Of course, the best backup is one that has been tested and verified.
So omit what you don't think you need, try to restore in a VM and verify you can get back your system using this data.
